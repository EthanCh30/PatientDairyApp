            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>Group therapy sessions typically consist of 6-10 participants and are guided by a licensed therapist. Each session lasts about 90 minutes, during which participants discuss specific topics, share their experiences, and engage in therapeutic activities. The therapist helps facilitate the discussion, ensuring everyone feels heard and supported. </p>
